# Image Processing Basics
Welcome to the Image Processing Basics repository! This repository serves as a fundamental introduction to image processing in the course Fundamental Biomedical Signal Processing (2023), tailored for the Neuroscience and Neuroimaging program at the Sino Danish center, Aarhus University and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

Whether you're a student diving into image processing for the first time or looking to refresh your knowledge, this repository covers key topics that are essential for understanding and applying image processing techniques.

## Topics Covered
1. Basic Introduction about Image Processing:
   - Gain a foundational understanding of image processing concepts and techniques.
2. How Colors are Processed in an Image:
   - Explore the intricacies of color processing in digital images, including color spaces and channels.
3. Point Processing:
   - Learn about point processing operations, which involve modifying individual pixels in an image.
4. Neighborhood Processing:
   - Dive into neighborhood processing, where the manipulation of pixels is based on the values of their neighboring pixels.
5. Morphological Operations:
   - Understand morphological operations such as dilation and erosion, crucial for shape analysis in image processing.
6. Spatial Transformations:
   - Explore spatial transformations to modify the geometric characteristics of images, including rotation, scaling, and translation.
